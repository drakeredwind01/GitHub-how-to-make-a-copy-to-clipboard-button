## test 1
At first figuring how to do this was insanly hard becuase I had no idea what I was doing or what this function was called first I thought it was a markdown but the below didn't work so I had to move on
```
testing markdown 
```

## test 2
then I was convinced it was HTML so I looked up a tutorial on how to make a copiable text with HTML and came up with this

```
<div class="container">
    <div class="label">
      Joining Link
    </div>
  
    <div class="copy-text">
      <input type="text" class="text" value="https://www.youtube.com/c/DrakeRedWind01?sub_confirmation=1>
      <button>
        <i class="fa fa-clone"></i>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
```
## test 3
I can't even remember how I cam up with the correct way of doing it all I know is the below works.
Hope this helps!




testing highlight `tesing`
testing code copy

It was the best of times. It was the worst of times
```

## This is where the tutorial Starts
Ok so if you want a `Box` you have to write "Tilde Box Tilde" 
```
`Box`
```

for code to copy all you need to do is print 3 Tildes on it's own line with the code under it when you are done write another 3 Tildes on the next avalible blank line.

it won't work if I use it in the code (it ends up being an entire blank line like below) so I will replace the Tilde with single quotes for this example
```
```
```
'''
if works = success
if not = try again
'''
```
