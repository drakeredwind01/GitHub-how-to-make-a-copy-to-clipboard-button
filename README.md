testing markdown 

testing highlight `tesing`
testing code copy
```
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times
```


Ok so if you want a `Box` you have to write "Tilde Box Tilde" 
```
`Box`
```

for code to copy all you need to do is print 3 Tildes on it's own line with the code under it when you are done write another 3 Tildes on the next avalible blank line.

it won't work if I use it in the code (it ends up being an entire blank line like below) so I will replace the Tilde with single quotes for this example
```
```
```
'''
if works = success
if not = try again
'''
```
